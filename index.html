        <h3>What is EVs?</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Electric vehicles have low running costs as they have less moving
          parts for maintaining and also very environmentally friendly as they
          use little or no fossil fuels (petrol or diesel).
          <br />
          While some EVs used lead acid or nickel metal hydride batteries, the
          standard for modern battery electric vehicles is now considered to be
          lithium ion batteries as they have a greater longevity and are
          excellent at retaining energy, with a self discharge rate of just 5%
          per month. Despite this improved efficiency, there are still
          challenges with these batteries as they can experience thermal
          runaway, which have, for example, caused fires or explosions in the
          Tesla model S, although efforts have been made to improve the safety
          of these batteries.
        </p>

        <h3>What Do Electric Vehicles Cost?</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The difference in prices between electric vehicles and gasoline cars
          is not as high as you might expect, especially since EV prices have
          been declining while the average gasoline car price has been
          increasing.
          <br />
          With the increasing popularity of sports utility vehicles and
          crossovers, the average American vehicle is getting larger and more
          expensive.1 According to Kelley Blue Book, the average price for a
          light vehicle in the United States increased in June 2021 to $42,258.2
          That's $19,317 cheaper than the average electric vehicle cost of
          $61,575 (after a federal tax credit; not including any state or local
          incentives)
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Price Parity Predictions</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Automotive experts are almost unanimous in their expectations that EV
          prices will decline and reach price parity with gas-powered cars in
          the next few years.
          <br />
          Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess anticipates price parity by 2025, while
          Bloomberg NEF predicts that EVs will be cheaper than gasoline vehicles
          “in about five years, without subsidies.”
          <br />
          With state and federal subsidies likely to continue into the near
          future, that price parity could come even sooner. In some vehicle
          categories, it is already here. Once price parity reaches the majority
          of vehicle types, experts predict large-scale market disruption, with
          EV sales outpacing sales of internal combustion vehicles.
          <br />
          There is one primary reason for the continued decline in electric
          vehicles, and a number of secondary reasons. First and foremost is the
          cost of the batteries that fuel the vehicles.

        <h4>Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV)</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Compared to an internal combustion engine, battery powered electric
          vehicles have approximately 99% fewer moving parts that need
          maintenance.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Advantages of a BEV:<br />
          - Creates very little noise<br />
          - No exhaust, spark plugs, clutch or gears <br />
          - Doesn't burn fossil fuels, instead uses <br />
          - rechargeable batteries
