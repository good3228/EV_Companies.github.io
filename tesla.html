          <h3>What is Tesla?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Tesla is a US company involved in car manufacturing and energy. Best
            described as a battery company, Tesla is best known for its electric
            cars. The company is also known for specialising in solar panels and
            Lithium-ion battery energy storage. The company first gained
            attention following the 2008 release of the Tesla Roadster, the very
            first electric sports car. Following the Roadster was the Model S, a
            sedan, which has since become the one of the world’s best-selling
            plug-in electric cars. In fact, as of 2016, the Model S ranks behind
            the Nissan Leaf as the world’s best-selling plug-in electric car.

          <h3>1) Battry Range</h3>
          <img src="./Tesla_Battery.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Electric cars nowadays have a big battery packed in side, some car,
            model S for example, can travel up to 1610 kilometers ( 1000 miles )
            in a single charge. Tesla’s battery is also capable of lasting 8
            years and can travel more than 160k miles throughout the battery
            life span.

          <h3>2) They are Fast!</h3>
          <img src="./Fast.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Electric cars engine layout is basically one motor for each wheels,
            which they could perform individually , therefore, a quick
            acceleration time and high top speed can can be achieved easily,
            take a Model S for example, in Ludicrous mode, it has beaten an
            Aventador in the acceleration time.

          <h3>3) Practicality</h3>
          <img src="./Practi.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Since there’s no engine in the front, all the machines that give a
            Tesla thrust are placed at 4 wheels, thus giving you more room for
            grocery, luggage, etc. In fact, you can put 2 to 3 bags of luggage
            in the trunk, not to mention there’s a front trunk under the hood,
            which can be used to carry some more extra bags. Even when fully
            loaded both front and rear, they still run just fine.
